# Phylogenetic Biology - Final Project

# Colonization of the Atlantic forest from the Amazon in neotropical anurans of the family Leptodactylidae

## Introduction and Goals
The goal of my project is to identify taxa from a widespread neotropical subfamily of anurans (Leptodactylinae) that colonized the Atlantic forest (AT) from the Amazon (AM), to create a phylogenetic framework to investigate their physiological evolution. To do that I will use phylogenetic comparative methods to infer the biogeographic history of tips, with particular interest in the colonization events that happened from the AM to the AF. I will use dated phylogenetic trees from my target taxa obtained from vertlife.org. Occurrence data for all available taxa of interest will be downloaded from the public repositories GBIF, IDIGBIO, and Vertnet, and imported into ArcMap. I will use shapefiles from the major South American ecoregions as defined by Olson et al. (2001) to assign taxa of interest to the ecoregions which they occupy. Then I will use the r package BioGeoBEARS to test different models for the biogeographic history of Leptodactylidae, and select the best supported tree using AIC scores. The phylogenetic tree obtained from that analysis will include ancestral range reconstructions, which allow inferring instances of colonization of the AF by AM lineages. The selective pressures to which organisms are exposed vary according to their geographic distributions, particularly for anurans, which depend on a delicate hydrothermal balance to maintain their activity and metabolism. Understanding the biogeographic history of anurans is therefore very important to understand the evolution of their physiological traits under different climatic conditions.
