# Phylogenetic Biology - Final Project Minimum Viable Analysis

## Main Goal:
Run frog data through BioGeoBEARS analyses and compare results through likelihood ratio test and AICs

## Specific goals
1) Prepare phylogenetic tree (newick file) and geographic data (text file) for analyses
2) Run 6 different models (DEC, DEC+J, DIVALIKE, DIVALIKE+J, BAYAREALIKE, BAYAREALIKE+J) available in BioGeoBEARS.
3) Select best model
